    <h2 style="text-align: center;">2022 Draft Grades</h2>
    <p>Diarrhea has interrupted this write-up too many times to count. It&rsquo;s only been my fault on one occasion. I probably shouldn't have had those three McDoubles after the draft on Sunday. Almost every other time has been Owen. I sit down to write, he starts crying, I pick him up to feed him, and a few ounces later, he blows out the side of his diaper and I lose all will to live. I feel like we just got out of the drive-thru, with my team pitching a mini-tent in my pants. How is it Saturday?</p>
    <p>With each season that goes by, time picks up speed it seems, and that&rsquo;s especially the case in this household. Days filled with a baby&rsquo;s mustard colored shit covering my clothes, a cranky wife who needs literally any hobby, and a workload that makes me miss 80-hour work weeks at South + Pine has me desperately seeking the escape of fantasy football season. Scouring the waiver wire for upside, sending out a dozen trade requests a day, listening to every podcast under the sun&hellip; my dick is hard as we speak.</p>
    <p>And then I look at my post-draft roster and I go limp. This will not be my year.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But before I get to that, everyone else will get their grades. Am I going to research what each player ate for breakfast and where they went to elementary school like in years past? Absolutely not. I&rsquo;ve got a few hours to work with here before Corin comes home from dinner with a friend, drunk off her ass on espresso martinis, to tell me she&rsquo;s feeling icky and has a headache tonight. <strong>(Editor&rsquo;s note: I was very wrong and doubted the power of espresso martinis!) </strong>I literally have a baby strapped to my chest right now because he&rsquo;s being extra needy. Hell, I&rsquo;ve got Erik waxing poetic about write-ups when the longest thing he&rsquo;s written in a decade is a company-wide email delivering malware to everyone&rsquo;s inboxes. Don&rsquo;t expect <em>War and Peace</em> here.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, all of this &ndash; the write ups, the league itself, Thanksgiving Eves spent risking ligaments at the ripe old age of 32 &ndash; is FTB forever. Girlfriends turn to fianc&eacute;es to wives. Our homes get more crowded. Our jobs become more hectic and demanding. With every year that passes, even without that beautiful trophy, I grow more grateful we still have this league as the little oasis in the desert to bring us together. I love you all, and wish your teams nothing but the absolute worst through January.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m grading out of 100 this year because it&rsquo;s easier for me. I&rsquo;ll take no questions on my reasoning. I haven&rsquo;t slept more than 4 hours straight since July. As always these are completely subjective and biased. Without further ado, in draft order&hellip;</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s about damn time something good happened to Jim. There&rsquo;s nothing a 3x champ needs more than the first draft selection. Now sprinkle on some voodoo. CMC will have a season that tops his 2019 campaign. Joe Mixon takes another step behind a better o-line. Saquon shows his rookie year form coming off a series of injuries. Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields show why they were hyped coming out of college. In my extremely biased opinion, outside of a great RB room, the QBs are unproven and weak for a 2QB league, and he leans heavily on Deebo to replicate last season&rsquo;s performance where he had to do everything based on necessity. Doesn&rsquo;t matter. We all know how this story will go. <strong>82/100, but every lucky break conceivable will fall in Jim&rsquo;s favor.</strong></p>

    <p>Bmas took a break from going to weddings to come visit us in North Jersey and draft. Buoyed by a late JaMarr Chase keeper selection as a result of last season&rsquo;s fire sale, it looks like he&rsquo;s put together a decent starting lineup. Najee Harris and D&rsquo;Andre Swift are expert favorites, even though their teams likely won&rsquo;t sniff the postseason. George Kittle sometimes does cool things when he isn&rsquo;t in a cast. Taking Tua in the 4th leads me to believe he&rsquo;s behind the TuAnon Twitter account (#ExpectUs). I can&rsquo;t wait to offer you one of my QBs for Tua and Swift. If I had written this Tuesday instead, I might be singing praises about the Allen Robinson pick. Regardless, he has a solid first ten. The bench is where things get a little shaky. Hopefully Kenneth Walker doesn&rsquo;t tank my Penny stocks but CEH and Miles Sanders and a rookie back in the a gross Bills committee don&rsquo;t exactly inspire much confidence. I&rsquo;ll give you a <strong>84/100 </strong>for the effort though.</p>

    <p>Erik drafted as if he were auditioning for The Fantasy Footballers. This roster includes almost exclusively players lauded by podcasters all summer. And jokes aside, there&rsquo;s plenty of balance. Erik understood that we&rsquo;re in a 2QB league with emphasis on passing TDs so he opted for two players known to air it out in Herbert and Wilson right out of the gate. The receivers and backs either have guaranteed volume (Allen, Cooks, Conner) or upside (Mooney, Olave, Etienne). The squad has no holes, the bench is deep. I&rsquo;ll dock a few points if only because the most positive outcome for Erik is that all of these upside plays pan out. I&rsquo;m really excited to watch his team score the most points and flame out in the first round. He gets an <strong>91/100</strong>.</p>

    <p>Bry steps right off the plane from Positano with a black book full of secrets and a dream. That book was an inch thick and could be used as a deadly weapon. Hopefully it explains taking Davante Adams <em>and</em> Hunter Renfrow because I don&rsquo;t get it. The dropoff from Javonte Williams to Devin Singletary to the third string Chargers RB is ROUGH. But that won&rsquo;t be this team&rsquo;s bread and butter. The team features two strong QB options in Mahomes and Prescott, and a stable of every type of wide receiver you can think of to carry him through. Ya can&rsquo;t start all of them though, so I expect Bry&rsquo;s early wheeling dealing days to re-emerge with a vengeance. <strong>82/100</strong></p>

    <p>The shock of the early draft was Jar eschewing common sense in favor of keeping a first round running back that surely would have fallen to him anyways. That said, in spite of saying he never has time to focus on fantasy&hellip;this is a decent team. I swear, all of that talk is a fantasy retirement is a ruse to get us not to focus on his consistency as a competitor. None of these picks really wow me, but you know what you&rsquo;re getting from each player. This is a roster of floors but not ceilings. Reaching for Justin Tucker in the ELEVENTH is a &ldquo;get your guys&rdquo; power play, but looking at the board, he might have missed some upside value skipping some receivers or even bulking up RB depth. The next kicker didn&rsquo;t go until the 16th round. He will beat me with a Tucker masterclass week this year. <strong>84/100</strong></p>

    <p>Guys I fucked up. This is arguably my worst draft ever, and I can&rsquo;t sugar coat it. Let me get some of the excuses out of the way now.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>No sleep, I have a baby. Father of 1.</li>
    <li>It was really hot where I was sitting. I couldn&rsquo;t think straight or see all of my cheat sheets.</li>
    <li>I was gassy from eating all that quiche and breakfast casserole.</li>
    <li>I overdid it with the adderall and had three cups of coffee. I was tweaking.</li>
    <li>Jay printing out his rankings from a desktop version of ESPN really threw me off.</li>
    <li>Steve kept calling out all of my targets before I could pick.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I was always leaning towards taking Lamar with my first round pick. He&rsquo;s in a contract year and generally has performed better with a chip on his shoulder. I didn&rsquo;t want any of the second tier of RBs at that price and drafting a safe WR at 6 seemed like a third place move. But what if CMC <em>actually</em> fell? What if Herbie dropped in my lap somehow? Paralyzed by that thought, I figured keep Trey Lance and hope he pops despite all of the negative training camp reports. With that I&rsquo;d have my two QBs or I&rsquo;d at least still have a projected top ten QB. Then what? It took me one round to tilt. Gimme all the QBs, I&rsquo;ll take Hurts please. Then Aaron Jones as my RB1 even though he&rsquo;s shown he&rsquo;s fringe top 10 at best&hellip;&nbsp; Then trusting Mike Evans&rsquo; hamstrings to get him enough separation before Brady is sacked&hellip; Then Tee Higgins with the likes of Sutton and Waller on the board&hellip; To cap off the tilt, we go with BREECE HALL as the RB2. The Jets o-line is a mess, they&rsquo;re a bad team, and after a rocky preseason he's in a committee with Michael Carter. Awful all around. I tried righting the ship by picking exclusively RBs in murky committees in hopes of hitting the lottery. I forgot to draft a defense and will likely lose to Erik the first week because of it. Dawson Knox is my TE over Mark Andrews. I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself for this. Prepare to be sick of me with all the trade requests. <strong>67/100</strong></p>

    <p>Dickie might be even busier than me these days, working his regular full time role <em>and</em> competing with Mr. Sell for realtor of the year. Between all that he must have missed the news that Stafford has a crusty rubber band holding his elbow together. But his Rams duo got him to the Finals, why not run it back? The strategy here almost look he tried Hero Every Position. There&rsquo;s a strong option and then a mixed bag afterwards. That said, I think there&rsquo;s enough floor and ceiling players to support another playoff run. Skyy Moore won&rsquo;t be a top 10 WR though. I fully plan on holding Dickie hostage for players on his team. If he really wants to be the one to sell my house and get that commission, he better start thinking what Mark Andrews and MT are worth! <strong>85/100</strong></p>

    <p>As I look through this squad, I can&rsquo;t help think of how we <em>all</em> have &ldquo;our guys&rdquo;. Kyler, Zeke, Tony Pollard, Daniel Jones&hellip;I all associate with Kuch. I can see Gabe Davis becoming a future &ldquo;Kuch guy&rdquo;. But some &ldquo;guys&rdquo; are worth breaking up with. Daniel Jones needs to be one of them. The top end is nice. I&rsquo;m in the camp that Zeke has some gas left in the tank. I really like some of the young receivers. You&rsquo;re hoping one of them takes the leap because you&rsquo;re asking a lot of DK with Geno Smith throwing him the ball. Two of his five RBs are handcuffs though. I&rsquo;ll be sending him trade offers daily. <strong>82/100</strong></p>

    <p>There is no multiverse in which Marcus Mariota was the plan. Deshaun being selected as the FIRST QB on the team in the ninth round of a 2QB league, despite being suspended for eleven games, is a Bricksquad Hall of Fame selection. In spite of the glaring flaws at the position, everywhere else is relatively stacked on paper. One injury to a top back and it may get late early for Arrowhead&rsquo;s Elite. I&rsquo;m guessing Dalvin Cook was a shoulder sympathy selection. There&rsquo;s a non-zero chance some random dude in Vegas releases the Kamara video the second he takes his first carry. Chubb will probably be flipped to Jay for Cordarelle Patterson and Malik Willis if Jay is even close to the playoffs and Steve isn&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t seen so many quality wide receivers outside of a BBW gangbang video. This grade is exclusively for you starting Baker Mayfield and Davis Mills and keeping a straight face. Lemme fix your team with a trade. <strong>79/100</strong></p>

    <p>In Eric Karabell we trust! Jay could have had Mason pick, and he&rsquo;d end up marching into the playoffs, chanting &ldquo;Winners win!&rdquo;, as if extreme luck and a favorable trade or two weren&rsquo;t the deciding factors. In true Ricky Bobby fashion, Jay&rsquo;s team either wins it all or finishes dead last. I&rsquo;m inclined to say this squad is the latter, and that will likely bite me in the ass. The league&rsquo;s commish/heel better be hoping Father Time and the Bucs' decimated o-line don&rsquo;t come knocking. If Tom Terrific can shake off Giselle&rsquo;s divorce attorneys and turn in another high passing volume season, there will be plenty of points from the QB position. I was stunned to see Derek Carr hasn&rsquo;t had more than 30 passing TDs since the Obama administration. The top three receivers are bound for consistent volume so there&rsquo;s a very high floor there. The pseudo-Zero RB approach leaves a lot to be desired here though. Jay might be banking on RB injuries more than me with some of these selections. At least he drafted a defense. <strong>83/100</strong></p><br>
    <p>That&rsquo;ll do it for this year&rsquo;s iteration of the draft grades. Tune in next year when I&rsquo;ve pulled off the improbable and write the subsequent version as the defending champ.</p>    <!-- End new page info here-->
