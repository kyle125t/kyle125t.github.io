    <h1>BS973 Fantasy Football Constitution</h1>
    <h2>Article I - Foundational Rules</h2>
    <p>This is a living document. All basic gameplay rules shall be based off of our current provider, ESPN Fantasy Football. Any other rules listed in this document are for formality and proceedings outside of ESPN. The hosting provider is subject to change. But in the interest of a better league, one not governed solely by the commissioner, but by the people, we shall put these rules in writing. The rules are as follows:</p>
    <p>The current commissioner can make decisions regarding rulings but cannot create rules. Rule changes can be proposed and voted upon in the off-season to be implemented the following season unless the rule depends on actions from a previous season (ex: keepers). In the event such a proposed rule occurs, it will skip the upcoming season and be applied in the subsequent season. In the event of a tie, the vote will not pass. Only majority votes will pass (6-4 or better).</p>
    <p>Your league officer is available if you have any questions or are in need of assistance.  If your question pertains to a feature provided by our hosting provider, please utilize their support resources before contacting a league officer.</p>
    <p>The current commissioner and league officer are responsible for scheduling the draft each season. To minimize risk for all involved, the draft will be scheduled within one week of the start of the regular season. The league must be reactivated by July 1st to allow owners to begin making preparations for the upcoming season.</p>
    <p>We agree not to engage in bribery of any material or intrinsic value. Keep it classy, keep it fair, keep this crazy train going. We won’t have much else going for us when we’re 40.</p>
