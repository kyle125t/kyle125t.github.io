    <h1>BS973 Fantasy Football Constitution</h1>
    <h2>Article I - Foundational Rules</h2>
    <p>This is a living document. All basic gameplay rules shall be based off of our current provider, ESPN Fantasy Football. Any other rules listed in this document are for formality and proceedings outside of ESPN. The hosting provider is subject to change. But in the interest of a better league, one not governed solely by the commissioner, but by the people, we shall put these rules in writing. The rules are as follows:</p>
    <p>The current commissioner can make decisions regarding rulings but cannot create rules. Rule changes can be proposed and voted upon in the off-season to be implemented the following season unless the rule depends on actions from a previous season (ex: keepers). In the event such a proposed rule occurs, it will skip the upcoming season and be applied in the subsequent season. In the event of a tie, the vote will not pass. Only majority votes will pass (6-4 or better).</p>
    <p>Your league officer is available if you have any questions or are in need of assistance.  If your question pertains to a feature provided by our hosting provider, please utilize their support resources before contacting a league officer.</p>
    <p>The current commissioner and league officer are responsible for scheduling the draft each season. To minimize risk for all involved, the draft will be scheduled within one week of the start of the regular season. The league must be reactivated by July 1st to allow owners to begin making preparations for the upcoming season.</p>
    <p>We agree not to engage in bribery of any material or intrinsic value. Keep it classy, keep it fair, keep this crazy train going. We won’t have much else going for us when we’re 40.</p>
    <h2>Article II - League Entry & Other Fees</h2>
    <p>The following fees will be collected yearly to finance league operations and prizes.</p>
    <p><b>Entry Fee:</b> $150 total per team</p>
    <p>Entry fee is subject to change with a unanimous league vote.</p>
    <h2>Article III - Prize Payout Structure</h2>
    <p>Our league awards cash prizes to the top 3 teams which reach the Championship playoff bracket.  We also award a weekly cash prize to the team with the highest score during each week of the fantasy football regular season.</p>
    <h3>Payout Structure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1st Place:</b> $825</li>
      <li><b>2nd Place:</b> $300</li>
      <li><b>3rd Place:</b> $150</li>
      <li><b>Weekly High Points:</b> $15 per week across the 13-week regular season</li>
      <li><b>The <em>Erik Adamonis Top Scorer </em>award:</b> $30 to the owner with the highest total regular season score</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Article IV - League Structure and Playoff Configuration</h2>
    <p><b>League Structure:</b> The league will be run through ESPN unless otherwise voted on and changed. Ten teams, no new friends. There will be no divisions.</p>
    <p><b>Roster Size (17):</b> 2 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 D/ST, 1 K, 7 BENCH</p>
    <p><b>Draft:</b> Snake format, live draft (when possible)</p>
    <p>All other specific rules can be found on the ESPN fantasy football website.</p>
    <p><b>Playoffs:</b> The league will implement a 4-team Championship playoff system. The top 4 teams will be determined first by win/loss record and total points will be used as a tie-breaker if necessary.  The Championship playoffs start on week 14 of the NFL regular season and will consist of two two-week rounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Semifinal Round:</b> Weeks 14 and 15</li>
      <li><b>Championship/Consolation Round:</b> Weeks 16 and 17</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This league will also implement an 6-team Loser playoff bracket. With the same structure as the top 4 teams.</p>
    <h2>Article V - Draft Order Determination</h2>
    <p>All owners will participate in a major golf tournament pool that will determine the draft order for the following season. The pool will be conducted during the major tournament that occurs closest to the scheduled draft date. Each owner will draft a team of golfers, and the outcome of all selected golfers in the tournament will determine the draft order. All rules for the golf pool competition are subject to the hosting site (ex: RunYourPool.com). If the golf pool selection occurs offline, rules must be set and agreed upon by a simple majority.</p>
    <h2>Article VI - Trades and Waivers</h2>
    <p>For a trade to be granted in a given week, it must be accepted THROUGH OUR HOSTING SERVICE (ESPN). Teams have the ability to veto trades before they are finalized. Trades are vetoed with at least 5 votes.</p>
    <p>Once accepted through ESPN,  a trade cannot be withdrawn by one party due to player injury, suspension, or any other unforeseen circumstance.  The only way a trade can be voided is if it is withdrawn by both parties before the trade is granted.</p>
    <p>During the 24 hour trade acceptance period, all owners (except those involved in the trade) will be given the opportunity to veto the trade.  However, those owners who choose to veto the trade must make a valid case to the commissioner for why the trade should not be granted.</p>
    <p>There are only 2 valid reasons which a trade can be vetoed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the players involved in the trade are not of comparable value.  Value must take into consideration the positions involved (QB, RB, WR, etc) and the specific needs of each team.</li>
      <li>If both teams aren't improved by the trade.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Waivers</h3>
    <p>Waivers are unlimited. The waiver order will be determined by whether or not claims were made. If you make a claim, you will be placed at the end of the order. In other words, if A, B, C, D, and E were the order, and only B made a claim, the following order would be A, C, D, E, B. The initial waiver order to start the season is the reverse of draft order.</p>
    <h2>Article VII - Keepers</h2>
    <p>Keepers are a manual process. Each season, managers may keep 1 player for the previous season. Players drafted in the 1st Round and players kept the previous season are unkeepable in the subsequent season. The player is to be kept +1 round from his previous season's draft round. For example, Justin Jefferson was drafted in the 15th round of the 2020 season, he is an eligible keeper for the 2021 season and would be kept/drafted in the 14th round (+1 round). To contrast, Alvin Kamara was drafted 8th overall in 2020 and is unkeepable for 2021.</p>
    <p>All keepers must be determined prior to the draft. A list shall be created and distributed to all managers with the player’s name, position, and keeper/draft round prior to the draft.</p>
    <h2>Article VIII - New Rule Creation</h2>
    <p>When a league dispute arises which has not been addressed in the league constitution, a discussion will ensue on possible resolutions. Rule changes can be proposed and voted upon in the off-season to be implemented the following season unless the rule depends on actions from a previous season (ex: keepers).</p>
    <p>Following the discussion period, the commissioner will create an online poll so that owners can vote on an appropriate course of action.  The result of the poll and any rule changes will apply for the upcoming season or the following season if the new rule affects roster considerations in the current season. The resulting ruling will be appended to the existing constitution for future reference.</p>
    <p>All poll outcomes will be determined based on a plurality and in the case of a tie the commissioner will use his infinite wisdom to cast the deciding vote.  When possible, polls will run for 2 days to give owners enough time to vote.</p>
